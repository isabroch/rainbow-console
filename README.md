# Rainbow Console
A package that outputs logs with their rainbow-colored equivallent.
Forcefully converts all input into strings.

## Installation
```bash
npm i @isabroch/rainbow-console
```

## Usage
```js
const rainbow = require("@isabroch/rainbow-console")

rainbow("Hello, World")
```

## Issues
Objects return as [object Object] instead of showing their properties.
